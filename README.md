 # Overview
Augmented Reality (AR) presents many opportunities for advancement in the medical research community for patient specific treatment. One of the many clinical applications of AR is in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). AR enables the possibility of superimposing preoperative MRI or CT scans onto the surgical environment in vivo in order to provide guidance to the surgeon during surgery. In order to advance research in this area, we need “ground truth 3D data”. This ground truth data will allow developers to have a ground truth point to point mapping in the tissue surface from frame to frame. This will encourage further development of AR algorithms in this space, because developers will be able to evaluate the accuracy of their implementation relative to a “gold standard”.
